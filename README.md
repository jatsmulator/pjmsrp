# PJMSRP (MSRP stack based on PJLIB)

PJMSRP is a sub project of PJRCS open source project, and it is a free and open source stack written in C language implementing the Message Session Relay Protocol, it supports RFC4975 and RFC 4976, can be used for file transfer or rich message communication as data plane, always combined with PJSIP as signalling part.
it can be integrated with your own project, both client and server applications.

You aslo can find MSRP statc in other open source projects, such as Doubango, libmsrp, rcsjta, but the stack has its own framework.
PJSIP and PJLIB is easy to use, cross-platform, good document and communities in the web, I really like it.
In case of this situation, I decide to port the MSRP stack onto the PJLIB.
